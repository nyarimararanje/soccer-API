# KickOff Football App
An iOS App that uses a soccer API to fetch up-to-date information about soccer players and soccer statistics.

## Project Motivation
I wanted to learn how API works and are integrated into different apps and websites, and so I put that together with my interest in sports, particularly soccer.

## Installation
Need an iOS running device, and it will have everything required to run the app. 
You will need a key, and this can be gitignored as it can be private for everyone running it.

## Project Outcomes
The project runs successfully, producing a list of soccer players. However, the information is not very up-to-date since it doesn't show some of the game fixtures.
